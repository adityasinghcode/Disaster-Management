PROJECT OVERVIEW

Natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and landslides pose severe threats to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. These events often cause widespread damage due to insufficient risk mitigation, poor preparedness, and lack of effective coordination among authorities and relief agencies.

This project presents an AI-based Disaster Management System designed to provide a comprehensive solution across all disaster phases:

Before: Early detection and risk prediction using machine learning models trained on environmental, climatic, and geographic datasets.

During: Real-time response coordination through alerts, dashboards, and integration with agencies.

After: Post-disaster recovery support, including resource allocation, transparent aid distribution, and progress monitoring.

The system leverages predictive analytics, data visualization, and API-driven architecture to empower decision-makers, NGOs, and communities. By integrating multiple stakeholders, it ensures faster relief distribution, improved transparency, and holistic recovery for affected populations.


GOALS AND SCOPE 

Early detection and prediction of disaster events.

Automated risk scoring and alert generation.

Resource & relief coordination dashboards (optional frontend).

Simple, reproducible training and evaluation pipelines.

FEATURES 

âœ… Early Detection & Prediction

Uses AI/ML models to forecast disasters like floods, droughts, and landslides.

Supports input from climate, satellite, and sensor data.

âœ… Risk Assessment & Mitigation

Calculates risk levels for specific regions.

Provides proactive recommendations to reduce disaster impact.

âœ… Real-Time Alerts & Notifications

Issues timely warnings to authorities, NGOs, and communities.

Multi-channel communication (dashboard, email, SMS, mobile app integration).

âœ… Resource & Relief Coordination

Tracks available relief resources (food, water, shelter, medical supplies).

Suggests optimal allocation routes to minimize delays.

âœ… Post-Disaster Recovery Support

Monitors recovery progress and rehabilitation activities.

Enables transparent aid distribution to avoid duplication or misuse.

âœ… Integration with NGOs & Government Agencies

Provides a common platform for collaboration.

Ensures accountability and faster relief response.

âœ… Data Visualization & Dashboard

Interactive dashboard to visualize disaster-prone zones, risk maps, and prediction outcomes.

Historical data tracking for better long-term planning.
